<p>
A survey conducted in Granger by the County showed that private drinking water wells in most of the area had nitrate-nitrogen &gt; 6 ppm. The County initiated the process to make a Drinking Water Protection Plan to address the issue.
</p> 
<br><br>
<p> We need your help to monitor the level of nitrate contamination in the Granger drinking water supply.</p>
<br>
<p>Why care about nitrate contamination? The residential drinking water supplies in Granger rely on private groundwater wells and it is known that a serious problem is nitrate contamination according to a survey by the St. Joseph County. Nitrate easily contaminates the water supplies from fertilizer applications or seepage of septic tanks. Ingestion of high concentrations of nitrates from contaminated waters results in methemoglobinemia.</p>
